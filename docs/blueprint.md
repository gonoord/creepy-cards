# **App Name**: Creepy Cards

## Core Features:

- AI Image Generation: Use generative AI to create creepy, vibrant images similar to Goosebumps content for new cards.
- Card Display: Display one card at a time with a creepy picture and a short phrase as a story prompt.
- Initial Card Set: Initialize the game with 80 random cards to get the user started.
- Add Custom Cards: Allow users to manually add new cards with custom images and phrases, storing them locally.
- Creepiness Filter: When generating images, apply a "creepiness" score based on prompt analysis using an LLM. An LLM "tool" scores images and prompts to filter out potentially non-scary images.
- Navigation Buttons: Include a go back to start button, a previous and a next button for navigation.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#6A449E), reminiscent of eerie twilight, setting a mysterious tone.
- Background color: Dark gray (#2A2A2A), almost black, providing a stark contrast to make the vibrant images stand out.
- Accent color: Electric green (#7CFC00), an analogous color used sparingly for interactive elements, adding a jolt of frightful energy.
- Use the existing fonts.
- Icons are stark, with high contrast and clearly legible.
- Ensure that cards display well on smaller screens.
- Subtle animations like flickering or a creeping shadow can be used on card transitions to enhance the creepy atmosphere.
